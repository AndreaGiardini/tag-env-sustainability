# Charter Environmental Sustainability WG
## Introduction
​​
This document outlines the charter for the Environmental Sustainability Working Group, a [independent Working Group](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/tags/cncf-tags.md) under the [CNCF ToC](https://github.com/cncf/toc).

## Problem Statement

Data Centers, and therefore every compute resource accessible, are currently using 2% of the world's energy. This is conservatively expected to grow to hold 1-2% in the next couple of years, up to 12% by 2040. The growth in energy for computing is out-pacing the global growth in energy production. The contributing factors include explosion in data, emergence of energy-intensive workloads such as AI and, the flattening of Moore's law. The energy consumption of data centers is therefore causing half of the Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of countries like Germany or Japan. GHG emissions are one of the key factors for global warming. In order to curb this trend, we should immediately start looking for ways to reduce the environmental footprints of increasingly large data centers. The good news is that there is also an increase in industry initiatives for environmental sustainability. This working group was formed to advocate for, develop, support, and help evaluate environmental sustainability initiatives.

## Mission

The WG Environmental Sustainability will work with the open source community to define environmental sustainability factors for the cloud native landscape, incubate and advocate open source projects to observe and measure Cloud Native infrastructure carbon footprint, optimize and eventually reduce carbon footprint and promote Cloud Native infrastructure to combat environmental challenges. We want to raise awareness of environmental sustainability as a key element of open source development and support projects which foster an understanding of energy drivers. All activities should positively impact the community by changing mindset, increasing efficiency, and putting sustainability on everyone's agenda.

## Goals

- **Ecosystem:** Foster and grow the ecosystem of environmental sustainability projects, users and maintainers
- **Best Practices:** Define procedures to improve environmental sustainability factors, develop benchmarks for the quantification of energy consumption of software, develop techniques to manage software such that the overall energy consumption and associated carbon is reduced.
- **Guidance:** Support open source tools that improve environmental sustainability factors and emphasize environmental sustainability concerns
- **Education:** Develop and participate in the creation of white papers regarding environmental sustainability within the open source space
- **Awareness:** Put environmental sustainability on the agenda of open source projects
- **Accountability:** Implement accountability of environmental sustainability in the open source community and create an impact on the green software engineering
- **Measurement:** Define environmental sustainability factors for cloud native and provide directions on how to create measurements
- **Overview:** Developing a landscape for environmental sustainability of cloud-native projects
- **End-User:** Support end user community to utilize and drive environmental sustainability activities and show correlations on potential cost savings
- **Reporting:** Regularly report  on the state of environmental sustainability in the CNCF to the ToC


## Non-Goals

- Creation of any new software projects
- Recommendations of individual projects or tools


## Cloud Native Alignment
The Environmental Sustainability WG works to enable widespread and successful adoption of the Sustainability pattern in cloud-native environments by:

- Providing valuable deliveries to the Cloud Native community, and objective information to CNCF TOC, End Users and Projects of the CNCF regarding areas considered in scope (see [goals](#goals) and [non-goals](#non-goals))
- Collaborating effectively with other related groups inside and outside the cloud native ecosystem
- Helping to enable environmental sustainability aspects within CNCF projects

- [Boavizta](https://boavizta.org/en) : a working group focussing on means of evaluation of the impacts ICT services have on the environment, regarding their full lifecycle and multiple criterias of impact (GWP, ADP, PE, …). The group works on open-source tools and methods, open data, including an open database of impacts
